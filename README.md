## Introduction
In this analysis, three questions were explored using AirBNB data from Seattle.
The three questions are described below.

## Question 1: Can I accurately predict price using just neighborhood location and size (max accommodation)?


## Question 2: Is there a relationship between review score rating and annual availability?


### Question 3: Can the data be used to predict review scores? If so, what variables are the greatest contributors to a high review score?
